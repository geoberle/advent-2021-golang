# Advent of Code 2021
In this repo you can find my golang solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2021

It has been a while since i was playing with golang, so i took the opportunity
of this years advent of code to motivate myself to dive a bit deeper into the
language. Please keep this in mind and don't consider the code a best practice
or golden solution to the challenges.
