# Day 2

When i solved the day 2 challenge in Python, i used lambdas to implement
the different navigation commands. I wanted to do something similar with
golang. I was really happy to find out that function references can be stored
in a map in a type safe way. Implementing a command lookup map with this feature
in mind was a breeze.

Since i loved the channel way of processing file line by line i just used
the same approach for this example.
